::: {#hero-heading}
I hold a Ph.D. in developmental science with a strong focus on analyzing complex, real-world data, exploring the stories behind the data, and deriving actionable insights through advanced statistical analysis and computational modeling. I am passionate about sharing knowledge and translating detailed analyses into clear, accessible insights for diverse audiences. To further this, I created [**DevStart**](https://tommasoghilardi.github.io/DevStart), a website where I share simple tutorials to help others understand and apply what I have learned over the years.
