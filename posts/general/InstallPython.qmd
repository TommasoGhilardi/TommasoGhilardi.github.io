Python is one of the most popular programming languages out there. We often use Python in our daily work to clean up and analyze data. This tutorial will show you my favorite way to install Python and manage its libraries. There are a few different ways to get Python on your computer, but this is the method I recommend for keeping things simple yet flexible.

## Installing python

One of the most used way to install and manage python is using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). While Anaconda is one of the most simple way to install python it is quite heavy. It install multiple programs and libraries that most of the time are unnecessary. Another option from the Anaconda website is [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), a minimal installer for conda. It is a small version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages. This means that fewer packages are installed and that we have more control on what to have on our PC.

However while these two options are widely used and I have also used them before, I prefer a 3rd option. [Miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/miniforge/)!! Miniforge is very similar to miniconda but has some small differences that set it apart from both Anacodna and miniconda making it the best way to isntall python for me. But what are these differences?

-   Similarly to Miniconda it is a lightweight installation of python that comes

My favorite way to install python is using miniforge!! Miniforge is an installer provided by conda-forge. Conda-Forge is a community-driven open-source project that provides a comprehensive collection of packages for Conda. It serves as an additional channel that users can add to their Conda configuration, offering access to a wide range of packages not available in the default Conda channels. Conda-Forge prioritizes well-maintained packages that adhere to best practices, establishing itself as a reliable source for Python packages. Its community-driven nature ensures a diverse and up-to-date package ecosystem, making it a valuable resource for many Python developers.

Once you press next and accept the conditions the installation program will ask you few questions like so:

I suggest to keep the same options I selected but feel free to change them if you know what you are doing.

Perfect press Install and wait for few minutes for the process to finish!! You are done!!

# Installing Spyder ide

Spyder is a powerful scientific environment ide written in Python. Spyder is designed by and for scientists, engineers and data analysts. It integrates very useful functionalities (variable explorer, plotting, etc.) making it our favorite way to write and run python code.

When you install the full version of Anaconda, it installs Spyder for you. However, Miniconda doesn’t come with Spyder. Fortunately, Miniconda does make it easy to install. In the Anaconda Prompt type following command and press the “enter” key:

``` bash
mamba install spyder
```

After thinking a bit, the Anaconda prompt will prepared a bunch of files to download and ask if you’d like to proceed. Go ahead and type “y” and hit “enter” to proceed.
