    "text": "Installing python\nOne of the most used way to install and manage python is using Anaconda. While Anaconda is one of the most simple way to install python it is quite heavy. It install multiple programs and libraries that most of the time are unnecessary. Another option from the Anaconda website is Miniconda, a minimal installer for conda. It is a small version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages. This means that fewer packages are installed and that we have more control on what to have on our PC.\nHowever while these two options are widely used and I have also used them before, I prefer a 3rd option. Miniforge!! Miniforge is very similar to miniconda but has some small differences that set it apart from both Anacodna and miniconda making it the best way to isntall python for me. But what are these differences?\n\nSimilarly to Miniconda it is a lightweight installation of python that comes\n\nMy favorite way to install python is using miniforge!! Miniforge is an installer provided by conda-forge. Conda-Forge is a community-driven open-source project that provides a comprehensive collection of packages for Conda. It serves as an additional channel that users can add to their Conda configuration, offering access to a wide range of packages not available in the default Conda channels. Conda-Forge prioritizes well-maintained packages that adhere to best practices, establishing itself as a reliable source for Python packages. Its community-driven nature ensures a diverse and up-to-date package ecosystem, making it a valuable resource for many Python developers.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you press next and accept the conditions the installation program will ask you few questions like so:\n\n\n\n\n\nI suggest to keep the same options I selected but feel free to change them if you know what you are doing.\nPerfect press Install and wait for few minutes for the process to finish!! You are done!!",
